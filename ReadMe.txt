It consist of several basic entities algorithms and 2 main functions - "Evolution_Dilemma" or "Iterated_Dilemma".
"Iterated_Dilemma" == 	2 or more entities are randomly compared between themselfs for given number of iterations.
"Evolution_Dilemma" == 	2 or more entities are randomly compared between themselfs for given number of iterations,
			but every iteration a given percentage of the worst performing entities is replaced by
			best performing entities
